Project Overview

This project implements a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using Node.js and Express. The backend exposes a RESTful API to manage resources (e.g., Books). The application follows a clean architecture with a focus on maintainability and scalability.

Code Structure

The backend code is organized into several directories and files:
project-backend/
├── controllers/        # Handles API requests and responses
│   └── bookController.js
├── services/           # Contains business logic for the application
│   └── bookService.js
├── models/             # Defines the data models (Book schema)
│   └── book.js
├── routes/             # Defines API routes
│   └── bookRoutes.js
├── app.js              # Main application setup (Express server)
├── package.json        # Project dependencies and scripts
├── Dockerfile          # Docker configuration for the backend

Key Files:
app.js: Sets up the Express server, middleware, and routes.
controllers/: Contains the controller functions that handle HTTP requests and responses for resources (e.g., bookController.js).
services/: Contains the core business logic for the application. In this case, bookService.js manages CRUD operations for books.
models/: Defines the data structure for the resource (books). book.js could be extended if a database is introduced.
routes/: Defines the API routes for different resources (e.g., bookRoutes.js).

Design Patterns

1. Controller-Service Pattern
The application uses the Controller-Service design pattern to separate concerns:

Controllers handle HTTP requests, validations, and responses.
Services handle business logic, CRUD operations, and interact with data models. This separation makes the application easier to scale and maintain as the business logic and API handling are modular.
Example:

bookController.js calls bookService.js methods to perform operations like createBook, getBookById, etc.
bookService.js contains the actual logic for manipulating data (e.g., adding, retrieving, or deleting books).
2. Singleton Pattern (for Data Access)
While this application does not use an actual database, the bookService.js can be easily extended to a Singleton pattern for managing a single instance of the data store (for example, when integrating with a database like MongoDB or SQLite).

The data storage (in-memory or simple file-based storage) is maintained as a singleton, which means there is a single instance of the resource data that is accessible across multiple API calls.

3. Factory Pattern (for Model Creation)
In case we plan to extend the app to handle different types of resources (e.g., Books, Authors, etc.), we could apply the Factory Pattern to create instances of models dynamically based on the type of resource. However, in this minimal example, it’s kept simple for clarity.

Design Choices and Trade-offs

1. In-Memory Storage
For simplicity, the application uses in-memory storage (a JavaScript array) to store the resources. This avoids the complexity of setting up and managing a database for this small app. The trade-off is that data will be lost when the server is restarted.

Pros: Simple to implement and no need for a database setup.
Cons: Not scalable, and data is lost on server restart.
2. No Authentication/Authorization
The application does not implement authentication or authorization. This was intentionally left out for simplicity. In a real-world application, security (JWT, OAuth, etc.) would need to be added.

Pros: Keeps the application simple and focused on CRUD operations.
Cons: Lack of security for handling sensitive data.
3. Express and In-Memory Data Store
The backend is built with Express, a minimal web framework for Node.js. For the data store, an in-memory structure is used, which is lightweight and fast for development but would need to be replaced with a database for production.

Running the Backend

Install Dependencies:
npm install
Start the Server:
npm start
The backend will be available on http://localhost:3000.
Future Improvements

Database Integration: Transition from in-memory storage to a persistent database (e.g., SQLite, MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
Authentication: Implement JWT-based authentication for secure access to the API.
Validation and Error Handling: Improve error handling with more specific error messages and use libraries like Joi or express-validator for validation.
Testing: Extend unit tests and add integration tests for different API endpoints.
